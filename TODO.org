* For v0.1
** set the output directory to be relative to the currecnt working directory
** write error handling
When the DB can't be connected to
1 stop the run with a halting exception
2 provide a useful error message
** https://racket.discourse.group/t/making-my-function-more-elegant/417/10 - better inner loops


* After v0.1
** heroicons - put in CSS folder.
** use koyo style for seperating packages
find out how to have command line app, libs, docs and tests in packages
** parse URLs for DB connections?
does koyo have something worth looking at?
** run this out of a docker container
** take rows in batches
** log level command line flag
** ignore rows and columns

* After v0.2
** Write out the results to file for JSON processing
** Send the results to a webapp
** Need to make a progress reporting web app.
** stop using SELECT * and move to explicit columns
** support mysql
** profile speed over:
*** long tables (5k, 50k, 500k rows)
*** wide tables (10, 1000, 10000 columns)
*** many rules (1, 100, 1000 rules)
** Score each kind of result (e.g. CC number 100, email 10)
** write tests for logging.rkt
the reason this is tricky is that it's a massive pot of side-effects and it uses threads
